*superiority model*

(humor as competitve play)
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

*arousal model*

(humor as emotional processing)
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

*incongruity model*

(humor as cognitive mismatch)

*humor as invitation to elaborate*

from elaboration likelihood model of persuasion

### Personal Aspects of Humor
#### A Brief Detour on *You*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

#### A Brief Detour on *You*

as a *person*, you may be:
- more/less humor-oriented
- more/less witty/sardonic
- more/less personable

*all of these can change with time and effort!*

[bell hooks]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

#### A Brief Detour on *You*

as an **instructor**, you may be:
- more/less immediate
- more/less technical
- more/less warm

*all of these can change with time and effort!*

### Personal Aspects of Humor

#### A Brief Detour on *You*

--- <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**personal perception**

- leaning into humor orientation is usually positive
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- makes faculty more approachable outside class
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- immediacy's effect on reception is unclear*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*all of these are subject to cultural variation*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: immediacy - engendering closeness

*inappropriate humor from immediate teachers is significantly worse

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**credibility**

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**credibility**

credibility comes from:
- expertise
- trustworthiness
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- goodwill
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

[Teven and McCrosky - 1997]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

Note: literally studied since Aristotle
- authoritativeness, composure, competency
- sincerity
- "know your audience" and what they want

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**credibility**

humor alone ups trustworthiness, goodwill, <br>
& composure, but doesn't increase competency

*on the whole, humor increases credibility*\*

*overuse upsets the balance by decreasing perceived goodwill
<!-- .element: class="citation fragment" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**qualitative work**

attempt frequency is all over the place

varies by uni, culture, country, experience...

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**qualitative work**

some profs don't use humor at all (< 2 attempts/hr)

award-winning lecturers warn against frequent use <br>
(avg 7.5 attempts/hr)

experienced faculty use humor more than GSIs <br>
(avg 6.5 vs 1.5 attempts/hr)

Note: sometimes upwards of 40% don't use, others less than 20%

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**qualitative work**

4 attempts/hr seems optimal <br>
*(but again, your mileage __will__ vary)*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**(dated) gender observations**

$\text{men}$: lean into content-relevance

$\overline{\text{men}}$: be wary of tendentious humor

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**main takeaway**

*you do you (appropriately)*

(and pay attention to your audience)

### Advice for Educators

### Humor and Learning

*what does the research say about utility?*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning

*all of this is hotly contested in literature!*

unsubstantiated claims in this section <br>
imply strong consensus in literature

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**retention**

on the one hand, <br>
numerous studies* find no change <br>
(a few even showed negative correlation)

*\*many discredited for study design issues*
<!-- .element: class="citation fragment" -->

Note: criticized for study design issues (retention time-frame, what kinds of humor, small n)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**retention**

on the other hand, <br>
some show positive correlation, particularly when:
- format/appropriateness is controlled
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- curriculum-relevant humor is used
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- retention checked 2 months post-lecture
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**attention**

humor is good at gaining/keeping attention

*IHPT suggests this is positive for retention*

Note: "substantial empirical support"

a humorous cognitive mismatch invites elaboration

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**main takeaway**

*keep it brief \& purposeful*
