### Theories of Humor

**instructional humor processing theory**

*arousal model*

*incongruity model*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

**instructional humor processing theory**

*humor as invitation to elaborate*

from elaboration likelihood model of persuasion
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
$$\Delta\text{attitude} \propto \mathbf P(\text{elaboration})$$
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

[Wanzer et al. - 2010, Allport - 1935, Ross - 1908]

***Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do***

- use explicit humor
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ridicule learners or learning
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- mock any groups or individuals
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*from here on out, appropriate humor only*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*from IHPT & superiority and arousal models*
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

Note:
- learning speeds/styles/preferences/differences
- your students, assistants, co-teachers, colleagues, yourself
- any marginalized *(or identifiable)* community **exaggerate, stereotype**

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

***Things You Might Do With Practice***

*use humor to ease emotional processing*

- protect oneself from intrusion
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- release tension following shock
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*be careful, it can also backfire*

### Theories of Humor
**main takeaway**

*use humor like a highlighter*

- choose an important concept
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- add flair with delivery/context
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- always restate the concept!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

invite deep thinking (elaboration)

*from incongruity model*

### Personal Aspects of Humor

*how does my personality affect my humor?* <br>
*how does humor change my image?*

### Personal Aspects of Humor
#### A Brief Detour on *You*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

#### A Brief Detour on *You*

as a *person*, you may be:
- more/less humor-oriented
- more/less witty/sardonic
- more/less personable

*all of these can change with time and effort!*

[bell hooks]

#### A Brief Detour on *You*

as an **instructor**, you may be:
- more/less immediate
- more/less technical
- more/less warm

*all of these can change with time and effort!*

### Personal Aspects of Humor

#### A Brief Detour on *You*

--- <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**personal perception**

- leaning into humor orientation is usually positive
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- immediacy's effect on reception is unclear*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*all of these are subject to cultural variation*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: immediacy - engendering closeness

*inappropriate humor from immediate teachers is significantly worse

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**credibility**

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**credibility**

credibility comes from:
- expertise
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- trustworthiness
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- goodwill
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

[Teven and McCrosky - 1997]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

Note: literally studied since Aristotle
- authoritativeness, composure, competency
- sincerity
- "know your audience" and what they want

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**credibility**

*on the whole, humor increases credibility*\*

*overuse upsets the balance by decreasing perceived goodwill
<!-- .element: class="citation fragment" -->

Note:
humor alone ups trustworthiness, goodwill, <br>
& composure, but doesn't increase competency

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**qualitative work**

attempt frequency is all over the place

varies by uni, culture, country, experience...

Note: some use none, some use lots.

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**qualitative work**

4 attempts/hr seems optimal <br>
*(but again, your mileage __will__ vary)*

Note:
experienced faculty use humor more than GSIs <br>
(avg 6.5 vs 1.5 attempts/hr)
+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**main takeaway**

*you do you (appropriately)*

(and pay attention to your audience)

### Humor and Learning

*what does the research say about utility?*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**attention**

humor is good at gaining/keeping attention

*IHPT suggests this is positive for retention*

Note: "substantial empirical support"

a humorous cognitive mismatch invites elaboration

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**retention**

numerous studies* find no change <br>
(a few even showed negative correlation)

some show positive correlation, particularly when:
- format/appropriateness is controlled
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- curriculum-relevant humor is used
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- retention checked 2 months post-lecture
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**main takeaway**

*keep it brief \& purposeful*
